             ENVISAT (ENVIronmental SATellite) is an inoperative
             Earth-observing satellite. It was launched on 2002, March 1st aboard
             an Ariane 5 from the Guyana Space Centre in Kourou, French Guyana,
             into a Sun synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 790 km (490
             mi) (± 10 km (6.2 mi)). It orbits the Earth in about 101 minutes
             with a repeat cycle of 35 days. After losing contact with the
             satellite on 2012, April 8th, ESA formally announced the end of
             Envisat's mission on 2012, May 9th.
             This European Space Agency (ESA) satellite is the most advanced
             environmental spacecraft ever built and the largest civilian Earth
             observation satellite put into space.

            ASAR is a high resolution imaging radar. It can be operated in 5
            distinct Measurement Modes, Image Mode (IM), Alternating
            Polarization Mode (AP), Wide Swath Mode (WS), Global Monitoring
            Mode (GM), and Wave Mode (WV). Within each mode, several different
            image swaths may be used. The swath layout is depicted in the
            following table. IM, AP, and WS modes are designated as High Rate
            (HR) modes and have a downlink rate of 100 Mbps. GM and WV are Low
            Rate (LR) modes and have a data generation of 0.9 Mbps. 
            In addition, ASAR supports 2 Auxiliary Modes (Test Mode, and Module
            Stepping Mode) and one Calibration Mode (External Characterization
            Mode) which are used for testing, calibration and instrument
            monitoring. Finally, one of five possible on- board data
            quantization methods may be used for each mode, though each has a
            default choice which will be used in most cases.
         </metadata>,

         <metadata category="instrument" name="AATSR instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The AATSR is an advanced version of the ATSR system operated
            successfully on ERS-1 and ERS-2. The main objective of the AATSR is
            the precise measurement of Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The AATSR
            will have a similar performance to the ATSR, but will include 3
            visible channels in addition to the 4 infrared channels, thus
            allowing it to observe land surface parameters such as temperature
            and vegetation characteristics. AATSR performs a conical scan with
            only those parts of the cone that fall inside the 500 km wide
            ground swath being sampled. The rearward part of the scan cone
            views the ground at approximately nadir, while the forward part
            looks at about 47 degrees from nadir. As a result, the AATSR
            produces two superimposed 500 km wide images, one from the nadir
            view and one from the forward view. These two views may be combined
            to correct for atmospheric effects. Spatial resolution is
            approximately 1km by 1km at nadir. On-board calibration sources
            provide internal references for the data to derive Brightness
            Temperature values from the radiance.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="DORIS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The DORIS instrument is a microwave tracking system that can be
            utilized to determine the precise location of the ENVISAT
            satellite. Versions of the DORIS instrument are currently flying on
            the SPOT-2 and Topex-Poseidon missions. DORIS operates by measuring
            the Doppler frequency shift of a radio signal transmitted from
            ground stations and received on-board the satellite. The reference
            frequency for the measurement is generated by identical
            ultra-stable oscillators on the ground and on-board the space-
            craft. Currently there are about 50 ground beacons placed around
            the globe which cover about 75% of the ENVISAT orbit. 
            On board measurements are performed every 7 - 10 seconds. Precise
            Doppler shift measurements are taken using an S-band frequency of
            2.03625 GHz, while a second VHS band signal at 401.25 MHz is used
            for ionospheric correction of the propagation delay. 
            On the ground, DORIS data is used to create precise orbit
            reconstruction models which are then used for all satellite
            instruments requiring precise orbit position information. In
            addition, DORIS operates in a "Navigator" mode in which on-board
            positioning calculations are performed in real-time and relayed to
            the ground segment. The accuracy of the various levels of orbit
            estimation provided by DORIS are shown in in the following table.
            As well, the use of a Laser Retro-Reflector will complement the
            positioning data achieved using DORIS.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="GOMOS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The accurate mapping of the ozone layer with GOMOS intends to
            search for daily and long term trends in the ozone distribution in
            the Earth's atmosphere through measurements with a precise self
            calibrating instrument. GOMOS measures tangential atmospheric
            ultraviolet, visual, and infrared light as a function of wavelength
            and altitude. Measurements are made by observation of stars through
            the atmosphere using a steerable Ritchey Chretien telescope and two
            spectrometers. Fast Photometers monitor the stellar scintillation.
            GOMOS performs multi-spectral observation of a selected set of star
            occultations of the Earth's limb caused as a result of satellite
            motion. In addition to monitoring ozone, GOMOS monitors other
            atmospheric trace gases (H20, NO2, NO3, OClO), temperature, and
            aerosols.
            The GOMOS telescope acquires and tracks the light from a
            predetermined number (about 25 per orbit) of stars, and passes the
            collected light to spectrometers and photometers. The ultraviolet,
            visible, and infrared spectrometers monitor selected spectral
            regions to deduce (in later ground processing) the amount and
            height distribution of the trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere.
            For each of the two spectrometers a two-dimensional image is
            recorded 2 times a second, yielding spectral information in one CCD
            dimension and spatial information in the other CCD dimension. The
            central region records light from a star plus light scattered in
            the atmosphere. The upper and lower CCD detector rows collect only
            scattered light which is used to correct the central region data.
            The Fast Photometers monitor stellar scintillation on two
            wavelength bands to correct for this atmospheric effect which would
            otherwise distort the spectrometer measurements.
            GOMOS operates in five modes:
            * Occultation mode, to monitor multispectral stellar absorption
            through the limb.
            * Linearity Monitoring Mode, to periodically (nominally once a
            week) check GOMOS response linearity. Spectrometer A and B central
            band spectra data are provided with variable integration times, and
            Spectrometer A and B upper and lower background band spectra are
            acquired simultaneously with the target spectra. This data enables
            the generation of LUTs for ground processing correction for
            non-linear pixel response.
            * Uniformity Monitoring Mode, to check (nominally once a week)
            pixel-to- pixel response uniformity while observing an extended
            source. Spectrometer A and B pixel by pixel data of 33 successive
            lines is provided with integration times within the range 0.25 to
            10 sec, and Fast Photometer 1 and 2 data on a pixel-by-pixel basis
            is provided with an integration time of 1 msec. This data enables
            the generation of LUTs to correct, during ground processing, the
            response non-uniformity of the CCD image.
            * Spatial Spread Monitoring Mode, to periodically check (nominally
            once a month) the pixel-to-pixel spectral image spreading response
            by tracking selected stars. Spectrometer A and B pixel by pixel
            data of 33 successive lines is provided with integration times
            within the range 0.25 to 10 sec, and Fast Photometer 1 and 2 data
            on a pixel-by-pixel basis is provided with an integration time of 1
            msec. This determines which CCD pixels of the star image to utilize
            for the Occultation Mode measurements.
            * Pause Mode, reached between any of the previous operating modes.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="MERIS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The MERIS instrument produces multi-spectral images (in 15 selected
            spectral bands between 390 nm and 1040 nm) obtained in a downward
            viewing pushbroom imaging manner. The 15 bands acquire radiance in
            the visible and near infra-red bands. MERIS measurement data are
            used to derive information including: 
            * ocean color parameters in open waters such as chlorophyll and
            coastal waters parameters such as chlorophyll, dissolved organic
            matter, and suspended solid matter concentrations, 
            * characteristics of clouds, such as top pressure and optical
            thickness, 
            * the presence of vegetation and derived indices to characterize
            vegetation vigor, and 
            * atmosphere parameters such as aerosol optical thickness, aerosol
            type, and water vapor column contents. 
            The MERIS instrument may operate at Full Resolution (FR) of
            approximately 0.3 km pixels at nadir, or at Reduced Resolution (RR)
            of approximately 1.2 km pixels at nadir. RR data is acquired on a
            global basis whereas FR data is acquired regionally by direct
            reception. In both the FR and the RR modes, the radiometric
            corrections are normally done on-board, although radiometrically
            uncorrected data may be acquired for correction on-ground. A
            Reduced Field of View (RV) mode is available primarily for
            performance verification purposes with data from 231 pixels
            selected within +/- 40 degrees from the subsatellite point and
            transmitted in FR for four lines. In RV mode, no radiometric
            corrections are done on-board.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="MIPAS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The MIPAS instrument measures atmospheric radiation emitted by
            trace gases in the infrared spectral range 4.15 µm to 14.6 µm. Its
            primary mission is to perform global observations of atmospheric
            vertical pressure and temperature profiles, and the vertical Volume
            Mixing Ratios (VMR) of five primary trace gases in the Earth' s
            atmosphere (O3, H2O, HNO3, CH4, and N2O). MIPAS information has
            application in ozone chemistry, monitoring of global distribution
            of major greenhouse gases, and atmospheric dynamics. 
            MIPAS measures emitted radiation while elevation scanning through
            the Earths' atmospheric limb within the LOS which has an
            instantaneous field of view of 3 km vertically and 30 km
            horizontally. Two scan mirrors enable viewing in both rearward
            (anti-flight) and sideways geometries (anti-sun), with scanning
            ranges of 35 and 30 degrees respectively. Sideways geometries can
            be used during special events monitoring only. 
            To acquire vertical distribution information for the trace gases in
            the atmosphere, vertical pointing covers a limb height from about 8
            to 70 km. A typical elevation scan sequence starts at 50 km and
            descends in 3 km steps to 5 km resulting in a duration of about 72
            seconds per scan. A maximum number of 75 acquisition heights (74
            step increments) can be commanded. In general, the duration of an
            individual scan depends on both the number of height steps and the
            commanded spectral resolution.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="MWR instrument description" type="text/plain">
           The MWR is a nadir-viewing, 2-channel passive microwave sensor which
           provides radiometric measurements at 23.8 and 36.5 GHz. The signals
           received can be related to surface temperature, but more importantly
           they provide an estimate of the total water vapour content in the
           atmosphere. This data is necessary to correct the RA2 data for
           atmospheric effects.

           The RA2 measures with high precision the distance from the satellite
           to the closest point on the Earth's surface directly beneath it. If
           the orbit of the satellite is determined by independent means (such
           as by DORIS) the RA2 data can be used to accurately map the Earth's
           topography. In addition, signal analysis of the returning radar echo
           can be used to provide insight into ground characteristics. 
            The RA2 is a nadir looking pulse limited radar operating at a
            nominal frequency of 13.575 GHz (Ku-band). A second channel,
            operating at a nominal frequency of 3.2 GHz (S-band) is also used,

            The SCIAMACHY instrument provides spectra measured from light
            transmitted, back scattered or reflected by trace gases in the

            of trace gases in the troposphere and stratosphere by means of a
            spectrometer scanning the atmosphere either at nadir or in limb. It
            records radiation in the range 0.24 µm to 2.4 µm with 8 detector
            modules. The goal is to allow small optical absorptions (as small
            as 2E-4 in some regions of the spectrum) to be detected. 
            SCIAMACHY is designed to measure the global distribution of trace
            gases, aerosols and clouds in both the troposphere and the
            stratosphere. The abundances of a number of atmospheric
            constituents which are targeted species include: 
            * in the troposphere - O3, O4, N2O, NO2, CH4, CO, CO2, H2O, HCHO
            and aerosols and, in polluted conditions, SO2; 
            * in the stratosphere - O3, O2, O2*, O4, NO, NO2, BrO, N2O, CO,
            CO2, H2O, CH4 plus under volcanic eruption SO2, plus under ozone
            hole conditions OClO and ClO. 
            SCIAMACHY makes spectral measurements in passive limb and nadir
            looking spectrometer observations to permit ground based
            computation of the trace constituent concentrations.
