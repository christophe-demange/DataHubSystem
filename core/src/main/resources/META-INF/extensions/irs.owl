            IRS-P6, also known as ResourceSat-1, is an Earth observation
            mission within the IRS (Indian Remote-Sensing Satellite) series of
            ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). IRS-P6 is the
            continuation of the IRS-1C/1D missions with considerably enhanced
            capabilities.
            The overall objectives of the mission are to provide continued
            remote sensing data services on an operational basis for integrated
            land and water resources management.
            The S/C mainframe is of IRS-1C/1D -P3 heritage (built by ISRO/ISAC,
            Bangalore). The S/C structure consists of two modules, the main
            platform and the payload module. The main platform is built around
            a central load bearing cylinder of 915 mm diameter and consists of
            four vertical panels and two horizontal decks. The bottom of
            cylinder is attached to an interface ring which interfaces with the
            launch vehicle. The vertical panels and the horizontal decks carry
            various subsystem packages. Various attitude sensors, SPS
            (Satellite Positioning System) and data transmitting antennas are
            mounted on the outside surfaces of the equipment panels and the
            bottom deck. Two star trackers are mounted with skewed orientation
            on the top deck. The payload module in turn is comprised of a
            two-tier system, the payload module deck and the rotating deck. The
            payload module deck accommodates LISS-3, AWIFS-A and AWIFS-B camera
            modules.
            The LISS-4 camera is mounted on a rotating deck which is attached
            to a PSM (Payload Steering Motor) which can rotate by 26 degrees. The
            entire payload module assembly is attached to a CFRP monocoque
            cylinder, which in turn is attached to the main cylinder of the
            main platform through a strut assembly for effective load transfer.
            The overall S/C size is about 2 m in diameter and 2.1 m in height.
            The total S/C mass at launch is 1360 kg, including fuel for five
            years of operation. Power is provided by a solar array generating
            1250 W (EOL), the array is articulated into the sun; in addition
            there are 2 NiCD batteries with a capacity of 24 Ah each.
            The platform is three-axis stabilized [2 star sensors in loop,
            magnetic bearing reaction wheels, RCS (Reaction Control System)
            with 12 nozzles, 8 with 1 N thrusters, 4 nozzles with 11 N
            thrusters], the pointing accuracies are 0.15 degrees, the stability is 3
            x 10-4 degrees/s. An onboard solid-state recorder (SSR) provides 120 Gbit
            capacity to store about 20 minutes of LISS-4 data. The S/C design
            life is 5 years.

            The LISS-IV camera is a high resolution multi-spectral camera
            operating in three spectral bands (B2, B3, B4). LISS-IV can be
            operated in either of the two modes. In the multi-spectral mode
            (Mx), a swath of 23 Km (selectable out of 70 Km total swath) is
            covered in three bands, while in mono mode (Mono), the full swath
            of 70 Km can be covered in any one single band, which is selectable
            by ground command (nominal is B3 - Red band). The LISS-IV camera
            can be tilted in the across track direction thereby providing a
            revisit period of 5 days.
            The Data products are categorized as Standard and have a system
            level accuracy.
            LISS-IV Standard Products comprise Path/Row Based products, Shift
            Along Track product, Georeferenced products and Basic Stereo
            products. Path/Row Based products are generated based on the
            referencing scheme of each sensor. Shift Along Track applies to
            those products covering a user's area of interest which falls in
            between two successive scenes of the same path, then the data can
            be supplied by sliding the scene in the along track direction.
            Georeferenced products are true north oriented products. These
            products are supplied on digital media only. Basic Stereo products
            comprise pairs of two images of the same area, acquired on
            different dates and from different angles. One of the parameters
            from which the quality of a stereo pair can be judged is the
            base/height (B/H) ratio. B/H ratio is the ratio of distance between
            two satellite passes and satellite altitude. Stereo products are
            available from LISS-IV Mono mode only. The inputs required, in
            addition to path/row details is B/H ratio. Two scenes selected on
            two different dates, satisfying the user's B/H ratio are supplied
            as a stereo pair. The data is only radiometrically corrected and
            are supplied on digital media.
            Standard Based and Geo Referenced products cover an area of 23 x 23
            km (3Mx bands) and 70 x 70 km (Mono mode). Basic Stereo products
            are Radiometrically corrected and cover an area of 70 x 70 km (Mono mode).

            The Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III) is a

            the visible and near infrared and one in the SWIR region, as in the
            case of IRS-1C/1D. The new feature in LISS-III camera is the SWIR
            band (1.55 to 1.7 microns), which provides data with a spatial
            resolution of 23.5 m unlike in IRS-1C/1D (where the spatial
            resolution is 70.5 m).
            The Data products are categorized as Standard and have a system
            level accuracy.
            LISS-III Standard Products comprise Path/Row Based products, Shift
            Along Track product, Quadrant products and Georeferenced products.
            Path/Row Based products are generated based on the referencing
            scheme of each sensor. Shift Along Track applies to those products
            covering a user's area of interest which falls in between two
            successive scenes of the same path, then the data can be supplied
            by sliding the scene in the along track direction. LISS-III full
            scene is divided into four nominal and eight derived quadrants.
            LISS-III photographic quadrant products are generated on 1:125,000
            scale. Georeferenced products are true north oriented products.
            These products are supplied on digital media only.
            Standard Path/Row Based products cover an area of 141 x 141 km and
            are characterised by 3 Bands. Path/Row Based products comprise Raw,
            Radiometrically corrected and Geo referenced levels of corrections.
            Quadrant products cover an area of 70 x 70 km and are characterised
            by 3 or 4 Bands (Geo Referenced). Quadrant products comprise
            Standard and Geo referenced levels of corrections.

            The Advanced Wide Field Sensor (AWiFS) camera is an improved
            version compared to the WiFS camera flown in IRS-1C/1D. AWiFS
            operates in four spectral bands identical to LISS-III, providing a
            spatial resolution of 56 m and covering a swath of 740 Km. To cover
            this wide swath, the AWiFS camera is split into two separate
            electrooptic modules, AWiFS-A and AWiFS-B.
            The Data products are categorized as Standard and have a system
