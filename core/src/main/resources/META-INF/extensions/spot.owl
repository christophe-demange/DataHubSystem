            SPOT-5 is the fifth satellite in the SPOT series of CNES (Space
            Agency of France), placed into orbit by an Ariane launcher. Since
            the first SPOT satellite was launched in 1986, the SPOT system has
            sought to provide continuity of service and constantly improved the
            quality of its products for the global user community.
            Background: In 1994 the SPOT-5 program was approved by the French
            government, consisting initially of two identical S/C in orbit and
            two new optical imagers for these S/C, called HRG (High Resolution
            Geometric) and HRS (High Resolution Stereoscopic) to provide a
            ground resolution of 5m. In 1996, the SPOT-5 program was downsized
            (to one orbiting S/C) and redefined to improve the spatial
            resolution of the imagery below 5 m. As a result, an innovative
            image acquisition and processing scheme has been developed by CNES
            to obtain spatial resolutions of about 3 m from two 5 m images. In
            January 1999, a further functional improvement was introduced
            giving the HRS (High Resolution Stereoscopic) instrument a full
            stereoscopic capability. It was also decided to continue to fly the
            Vegetation instrument. The SPOT-5 satellite program continues the
            partnerships of France (CNES), Belgium (OSTC) and Sweden (SNSB) as
            established at the beginning of the SPOT program.
            The overall mission objectives are:
            * To provide image acquisition and service continuity consistent
            with previous SPOT satellites to satisfy the user investments.
            Hence, the same sun-synchronous orbit is used providing the
            existing functional instrument capabilities with a 26 day repeat
            cycle, the same off-track viewing capability of +/- 27� about
            nadir, the same spectral band selection, and the same 60 km double
            swath.
            * To improve the spatial resolution of the imagery to < 3 m in the
            panchromatic band and to 10 m in the multispectral mode. The SWIR
            band imagery remains at 20 m.
            * To offer in parallel a stereoscopic along-track observation
            capability (instead of the previously provided cross-track
            capability). The intend is to offer high-resolution imagery to be
            used for DEM (Digital Elevation Model) generation with an accuracy
            of 10 m.
            The SPOT-5 satellite configuration takes advantage of the SPOT-4
            bus design, using the extended platform design (SPOT MK2, provided
            by MMS) and service module accommodates twice the payload of the
            SPOT 3 bus. The ACS (Attitude Control Subsystem) provides a
            pointing accuracy of 0.05� and an attitude restitution of 6 x 10-5
            radians. This excellent location accuracy [autonomous star tracker
            SED16 manufactured by EADS- Sodern, France] corresponds to < 50 m
            without ground control points (instead of 350 m on SPOT 1 to 4).
            The S/C structure has dimensions of: 3.4 m x 3.1 m x 6 m (excluding
            the solar array). The OBC (Onboard Processor) consists of a Marconi
            MDC 31750 processor. The S/C mass is 3030 kg at launch, power =
            2400 W (EOL), batteries = 4 x 40 Ah, design life = 5-7 years. Note:
            In 2000 MMS became part of EADS Astrium.
            The SPOT-5 spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally in
            2012 (10th year of on-orbit operations). The SPOT-5 local hour is
            slowly drifting since maneuvers for inclination correction are no
            more performed (hydrazine is saved for end of life operations). The
            end-of-life of SPOT-5 has been adjusted to: end of 2014/beginning
            of 2015.

            HRG was built by Astrium SAS of V�lizy, France to continue to
            improve the HRVIR service of SPOT-4. Two HRG instruments are
            provided in the conventional SPOT-series double-observation
            configuration, each with a FOV of 4.13� and the same cross-track
            pointing capabilities of +/- 27+ as the HRVIR imager on SPOT-4. The
            observation coverage of each HRG is 60 km in the nadir direction
            and >80 km in the oblique configuration (same two-swath coverage as
            before). The main components of the HRG instrument are:
            * Stable structure supporting its mechanisms
            * Optical subassembly
            * Detection electronics
            * Ancillary electronics.
            HRG features a new linear detector array configuration geometry for
            the panchromatic band using two parallel rows (i.e., a dual array)
            of 12000 silicon CCD detectors (6.5 �m in size) for each
            instrument. The two PAN detector lines are offset in the focal
            plane in such as way as to provide coincident imagery of the same
            instantaneous cross-track area, each at a spatial resolution of 5
            m. [Note: The dual array in the focal plane (offset by one half
            pixel in one direction and 3.5 pixels in the other to avoid
            overlapping) is sufficient to improve the sampling grid without
            doubling each array's acquisition rate. The new sampling concept is
            based on Shannon's theory of information which states that "the
            sampling frequency must be equal to or greater than twice the
            maximum signal frequency" to obtain clean images using
            interpolation.] The CCD integration time is within 0.75 ms for a
            dual-array observation in cross-track of 60 km in which the S/C is
            moving 5 m in the along-track direction.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="HRS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            The HRS instrument was developed and built by EADS Astrium SAS,
            sponsored by CNES and SPOT IMAGE.
            The objective is to provide large-area along-track stereoscopic
            panchromatic imagery with good altimetric accuracy (5-10 m relative
            and 10-15 m absolute). Applications of the stereo imagery are seen
            in various fields such as map making and in the generation of DTMs
            (Digital Terrain Model) The panchromatic band (0.51-0.73 �m) of
            SPOT-1, -2, -3 is being reintroduced. The HRS instrument features
            two telescopes allowing a 20� fore view and a 20� aft view over a
            120 km swath, respectively. A spatial resolution of 10 m is
            provided in cross-track and 5 m (parallax direction) in
            along-track. The stereo acquisition mode can be sustained for scene
            lengths of up to 600 km. HRS uses the same CCD line detector design
            as for the HRG instrument.

            the prime contractor and built by SODERN of Limeil-Brivannes],
            providing the capability of wide-area monitoring of the Earth's
            vegetation (VMI features advanced optics that allow perfect
            geometrical rectification of the pictures despite the wide swath
            width. The VMI optics virtually cancel the curvature of the Earth
            to provide directly usable geographical information). Calibration
            accuracy: interband and multitemporal =3%, absolute = 5%; TFOV =
            101� (swath width of about 2200 km); pixel size = 1.15 km at nadir;
            location accuracy < 0.5 km, local distortion <0.3 pixel,
            collocation with HRVIR sensor data = 0.3 km for simultaneous
            acquisitions. Spatial coverage: about 90% of the equatorial regions
            are imaged each day (total daily imaging for latitudes >35�).
            The instrument collects radiation reflected by the earth's surface.
            Silicon linear detector arrays are used for spectral band B0
            (blue), B2 (red) and B3 (near infrared), while InGaAs photodiodes
            (Thomson CSF) are used for the SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) band.
            Each array features 1728 individual CCD detectors. The output
            voltage signals are fed to a multiplexer (prior to this, SWIR
            voltages are adjusted for dark current values), then to a single
            analog to digital converter(ADC). All sensors are processed by a
            single high precision 11 bit ADC, thus completely by-passing the
            problem of electronic interband calibration.
            The Vegetation package is an independent add-on payload to the SPOT
            satellite [the package includes the sensor, a solid-state recorder
            (up to 97 minutes of imagery), an X- and L-band telemetry
            subsystem, and a computer]. The instrument design uses four
            cameras, one for each spectral band, each camera is covering the
            TFOV. Vegetation payload parameters: mass = 152 kg, power = 200 W,
            instrument size = 0.7 m x 1 m x 1 m, data transmit frequencies in
            X-band (8153 MHz) at 3.4 Mbit/s, and L-band (1704 MHz), data rate
            of sensor (L-band) = 510 kbit/s.

         <metadata category="instrument" name="DORIS instrument description" type="text/plain">
            DORIS is a satellite-based orbit determination and radiopositioning
            system, designed and developed by CNES, GRGS (Groupe de Recherches
            de G�od�sie Spatiale), CNRS/Universit� Paul Sabatier) and IGN
            (Institut G�ographique National). The SPOT-4 DORIS package includes
            experimental software (DORIS/DIODE experiment) to provide the POD
            (Precise Orbit Determination) function in real-time to within <0.3
            m on the radial component. 23)
            DORIS is an RF system using a dual-frequency Doppler (400 MHz and 2
            GHz) uplink to measure the velocity of a satellite in orbit
            relative to a global, permanent network of 51 so-called
            "orbitography" beacons. At the same time the system can be used to
            locate beacons on the ground. Two "master" beacons serve as time
            and frequency references for the system and also handle uploading
            of the commands and data needed by the onboard receiver.
            The instrument consists of a receiver (MVR- range rate measuring
            device), a USO (Ultrastable Oscillator) and an omnidirectional
            antenna, all carried on the host satellite. The receiver takes
            Doppler shift measurements of 400 MHz and 2 GHz radio signals
            transmitted by the beacons. The 400 MHz measurement is being used
            to correct errors caused by ionospheric signal propagation.
